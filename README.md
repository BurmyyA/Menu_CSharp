# Menu_CSharp
## What is this project?
This project is a burger joint menu. You may order burgers, fries, and a drink or only 1 or 2 if you would like. 

## What did I learn? I learned that when using radio buttons it will always be if statements for each one as you may only choose 1 radio button at a time in a group box.
